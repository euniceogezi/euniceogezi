## Hi, I'm Eunice
I’m a cybersecurity student building hands-on experience across networking, Linux systems, and cyber operations through labs, simulations, and security challenges.
My work focuses on understanding how systems are configured, how services communicate, how access is controlled, and how security teams detect and respond to suspicious activity in real environments.
Alongside my technical learning, I bring a strong operational and documentation mindset from my professional background, which shapes how I approach risk, reliability, and system discipline.

## What I’m Working On
- Network configuration and simulation (routers, DHCP, DNS, web servers, file transfer, ACLs)
- Security fundamentals and lab-based learning
- Hands-on cyber practice using virtual environments
- Scripting and tooling basics (learning)
